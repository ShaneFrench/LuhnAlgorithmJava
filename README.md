HTML & PHP University Work
I completed this work during my Web Applications Development module at University, 
this involved a combination of HTML front end development and PHP coding which was 
stored on my x10Hosting web service account, although this account is now deactivated, 
I was able to rescue a file which shows a snippet of the work in which I completed during this module.
